# Single Number
 Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
 Note:
 Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

# Solutions:

# Swift
```
O(n)
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
