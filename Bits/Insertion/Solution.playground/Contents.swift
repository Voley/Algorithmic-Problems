/*
 Insertion
    You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit `j` and ends at bit `i`. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
    EXAMPLE
    Input:     N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
    Output:    N = 10001001100
