# Draw Line
A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The creen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the lenfth of the array and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).
