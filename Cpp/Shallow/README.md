# Shallow vs. Deep Copy
What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy? Explain how you would use each.

# Solutions:
  
A shallow copy copies the object and maintains references to the original objects.
A deep copy will copy (clone) the objects too so they bear no relation to the original. Implicit in this is that the object themselves are deep copied.
