# Peaks and Valleys
In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element which is greater than or equal to the adjacent integers and a "valley" is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent integers. For example, in the array [5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6], [8, 6] are peaks and [5, 2] are valleys. Given an array of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.

Example:
```
Input: [5, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [5, 1, 3, 2, 3]
```
