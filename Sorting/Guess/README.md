# Guess Number Higher or Lower
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:  
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.  
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.  
You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0).
