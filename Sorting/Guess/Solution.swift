/*
 Guess Number Higher or Lower
     We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
     I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
     Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
     You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0).
