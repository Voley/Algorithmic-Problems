# Sorted Search, No Size
You are given an array-like data structure `Listy` which lacks a size method. It does, however have an `elementAt(i)` method that returns the element at index i in O(1) time. If i is beyond the bounds of data structure, it returns -1. Given a `Listy` of sorted, positive integers, find the index at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times, you may return any index.
