# URLify

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with "%20". You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

# Solutions:

# Swift
```
O(n) and O(n) memory
```
# C++
```
O(n) - works in place
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run C++ files and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
