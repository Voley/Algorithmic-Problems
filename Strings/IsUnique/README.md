# Is Unique

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

# Solutions:

# Swift
```
O(n log n)
O(n) and O(n) memory
```
# C++
```
O(n) and O(n) memory
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run C++ files and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
