# One Away
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.


# Solutions:

# Swift
```
O(n), where n is the length of shortest string
```
# C++
```
O(n), where n is the length of shortest string
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run C++ files and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
