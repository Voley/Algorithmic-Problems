# Increasing Triplet Subsequence

Given an unsorted array return whether an increasing subsequence of length 3 exists or not in the array.
  
Formally the function should:  
Return true if there exists i, j, k   
such that arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] given 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n-1 else return false.  
Your algorithm should run in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.  
  
Examples:  
Given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],  
return true.  
  
Given [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],  
return false.
