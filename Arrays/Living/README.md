# Living People
Given a list of people with their birth and death years, implement a method to compute the years with the most number of people alive. You may assume that all people were born between 1900 and 2000(inclusive). If a person was alive during any portion of that year, they should be included in that year's count. For example, Person (birth = 1908, death = 1909) is included in the counts for both 1908 and 1909.
