# String Compression
 Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.
 The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.
 Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.
 After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.


# Solutions:

# Swift
```
O(n), where n is the number of elements in matrix
```
# C++
```
O(n), where n is the number of elements in matrix
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run C++ files and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
