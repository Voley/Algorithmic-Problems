# Missing Number
An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer A with a single operation. The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is "fetch the kth bit of A[i]"m which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer.
