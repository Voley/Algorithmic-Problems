# Zero Matrix
Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.


# Solutions:

# Swift
```
O(n), where n is the number of elements in matrix (in place)
O(n) + O(n) extra memory
```
# C++
```
O(n), where n is the number of elements in matrix
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run C++ files and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
