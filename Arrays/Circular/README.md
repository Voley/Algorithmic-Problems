# Circular Array
Implement a `CircularArray` class that supports an array-like data structure which can be effeciently rotated. If possible, the class should use a generic type (also called a template), and should support iteration via the standard `for item in array` notation.

# Solutions:

# Swift
```
insertion - O(1)
rotation - O(1)

```
# Installation
Run `make` to build and run C++ files and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
