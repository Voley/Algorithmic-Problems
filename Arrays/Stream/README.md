# Moving Average from Data Stream
Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.  
  
For example,  
```
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);  
m.next(1) = 1  
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2  
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3  
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3  
```
