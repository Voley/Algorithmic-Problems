# Recursive Multiply
Write a recursive function to multiply two positive integers without using the * operator. You can use addition, substraction and bit shifting, but you should minimize the number of those operations.
    
# Solutions:

# Swift
`O(log n)`

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
