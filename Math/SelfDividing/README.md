#  Self Dividing Numbers
 A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.
 For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.
 Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.
 Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.
