# Strobogrammatic Number

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).
  
Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.
  
For example, the numbers "69", "88", and "818" are all strobogrammatic.
