# Stack Min
How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function `min` which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.

# Solutions:

# Swift
```
O(n)
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run C++ files and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
