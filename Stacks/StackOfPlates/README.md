# Stack of Plates
Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure `SetOfStacks` that mimics this. `SetOfStacks` should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once a previous one exceeds capacity.
`SetOfStacks.push()` and `SetOfStacks.pop()` should behave identically to a singles stack (that is, `pop()` should return the same values as it would if there just a single stack).
