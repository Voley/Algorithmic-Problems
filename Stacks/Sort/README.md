# Sort Stack
Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on top. You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek` and `isEmpty`

# Solutions:

# Swift
```
O(n^2)
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run C++ files and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
