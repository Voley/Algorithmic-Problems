# Basic Calculator
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.
You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
Some examples:
"3+2*2" = 7
" 3/2 " = 1
" 3+5 / 2 " = 5
Note: Do not use the eval built-in library function.

# Solutions:

# Swift
```
O(n)
```
# C++
```
O(n)
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run C++ files and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
