# Paths with Sum
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards(traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

# Solutions:

# Swift
```
O(n) with O(n) memory
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
