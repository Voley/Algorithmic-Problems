# Random Node
You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch which, in addition to insert, find and delete, has a method getRandomNode() which returns a random node from the tree. All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen. Design and implement an algorithm to getRandomNode, and explain how you would implement the rest of the methods.

# Solutions:
