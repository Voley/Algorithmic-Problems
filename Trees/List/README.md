# List of Depths
Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g. if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists)

# Solutions:

# Swift
```
O(n) + O(n) memory
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
