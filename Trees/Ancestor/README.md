# First Common Ancestor
Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional notes in a data structure. NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree.

# Solutions:

# Swift
```
`O(n), where n is height of furtherst node from ancestor`
```

# Installation
Run `make` to build and run Swift files. Or you can run `.playground` file.
