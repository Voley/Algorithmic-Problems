# BST Sequences

A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right and inserting each element. Given a binary search tree with distinct elements, print all possible arrays that could have led to this tree.
```
EXAMPLE
....2
..1...3
```
Output: `{2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}`
