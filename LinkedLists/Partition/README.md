# Partition
Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the “right partition”; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

Example
Input: 3-5-8-5-10-2-1 [partition = 5]
Output: 3-1-2-10-5-5-8
