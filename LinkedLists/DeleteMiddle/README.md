# Delete Middle Node
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node

Example:
Input: node c from a-b-c-d-e-f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a-b-d-e-f
