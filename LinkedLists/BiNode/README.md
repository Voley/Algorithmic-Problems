# BiNode
Consider a simple data structure called `BiNode`, which has pointers to two other nodes. The data structure `BiNode` could be used to represent both a binary tree (where `node1` is the left node and `node2` is the right node) or a doubly linked list (where node1 is the previous node and node2 is the next node). Implement a method to convert a binary search tree (implemented with BiNode) into a doubly linked list. The values should be kept in order and the operation should be performed in place (that is, on the original data structure).
