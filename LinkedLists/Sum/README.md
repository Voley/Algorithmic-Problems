# Sum Lists
You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

Example:
Input: 7-1-6 + 5-9-2, that is 617 + 295
Output: 2-1-9, that is 912

Follow up:
Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
Example:
Input: 6-1-7 + 2-9-5, that is 617 + 295
Output: 9-1-2, that is 912
