# Robot in a Grid
Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with `r` rows and `c` columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.
