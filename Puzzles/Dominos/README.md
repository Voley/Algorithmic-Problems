# Dominos
There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

# Solutions:
It's impossible. There are two proofs.  
1. Place dominoes in a row. One dominoe will always poke out to next level. Thus when you approach the last row, you can't fill it without overflowing.  
2. When you remove two corners from one diagonal, you will have 32 squares of one color and 30 of another. Dominoe covers exactly one white and black square. So you can't cover all of them.
